        <h2>The Origins of Stamp Collecting</h2>
        <p>Stamp collecting, also known as philately, is the collection and study of postage stamps and other related
            philatelic materials. The hobby of stamp collecting began shortly after the introduction of the world's
            first postage stamp, the Penny Black, in 1840.</p>
        <p>The Penny Black was issued by the United Kingdom and quickly gained popularity among the public, who were
            excited by the convenience of this new way to send letters. Soon, people began collecting these stamps as a
            hobby, and the practice of philately was born.</p>

        <h2>The Golden Age of Stamp Collecting</h2>
        <p>The late 19th and early 20th centuries are often referred to as the "Golden Age" of stamp collecting. During
            this time, the number of stamp collectors grew exponentially, and the hobby became increasingly popular
            among the upper and middle classes.</p>
        <p>The rise of the postal system and the increasing availability of stamps from around the world fueled the
            growth of philately. Collectors began to specialize in certain countries, themes, or time periods, and the
            first stamp collecting clubs and societies were formed.</p>
